# Correlation Analysis of Happiness Factors

## Analysis Overview
The analysis was performed on data from `happiness.csv`, focusing on the relationships between various factors affecting individual well-being, specifically exploring correlations among parameters such as GDP per capita, life support, and emotional well-being indicators.

## Key Insights

1. **GDP per Capita and Life Support**:
   - A strong positive correlation (**0.78**) exists between GDP per capita and Life Ladder scores, indicating that as GDP rises, so do perceptions of life support.

2. **Life Choices**:
   - Life choices are positively correlated with GDP per capita (**0.36**) and moderately correlated with life support (**0.60**), revealing that economic circumstances positively influence perceptions regarding personal autonomy.

3. **Negative Correlation with Corruption**:
   - Corruption exhibits a strong negative correlation (**-0.43**) with life support, indicating that increased corruption correlates with diminished perceptions of life quality.
   - The findings also show a negative correlation with life choices (**-0.27**), suggesting that corruption detracts from personal decision-making.

4. **Lifespan and Well-being**:
   - Healthy life expectancy at birth correlates positively with life support (**0.40**) and GDP per capita (**0.30**), implying better life quality outcomes in economically favorable conditions.

5. **Negative Affect and Well-being**:
   - Negative affect correlates negatively with both life support (**-0.35**) and life choices (**-0.27**), suggesting that negative emotions adversely impact perceptions of life quality.

6. **Generosity**:
   - Generosity has a weak negative correlation with life choices (**-0.15**) and a very weak correlation with corruption (**-0.07**), indicating limited impact on personal decision-making and perceptions of societal ethics.

## Summary of Insights
The correlation analysis reveals a multifaceted relationship between economic conditions, personal well-being, and social factors such as corruption and generosity. A high GDP per capita is closely associated with improved perceptions of life quality and personal choices. In contrast, corruption negatively influences these perceptions, while negative emotions further compound feelings of dissatisfaction. The weak links between generosity and other factors suggest that enhancing economic conditions and addressing corruption might be critical for improving overall societal well-being.

## Implications of Findings
The implications of these findings suggest that policymakers should prioritize economic enhancement and effective measures to combat corruption. Improving these areas could significantly elevate societal well-being, foster positive personal choices, and mitigate negative emotions within the population. In essence, a socioeconomic focus appears beneficial for improving quality of life and citizen happiness.

## Chart Analysis Summary

![Chart Analysis](chart_2.png)

The chart illustrates a scatter plot comparing actual values to predicted values, with a line representing perfect predictions (y = x).

### Insights from the Chart:

1. **Correlation**: There is a strong positive correlation between the actual and predicted values, indicating that the model is making reasonably accurate predictions.

2. **Distribution of Points**: Most of the data points are clustered around the line y = x, suggesting that the predictions are generally close to the actual values.

3. **Outliers**: There are a few points that deviate significantly from the line, indicating potential outliers where the model may have missed the mark.

4. **Overall Trend**: The line of best fit closely follows y = x, suggesting that the model performs well in predicting values within the range provided in the dataset.

### Summary of Findings

The model demonstrates strong predictive capability, with a notable alignment between actual and predicted values. However, attention should be given to the outlier points that may indicate instances of error or areas for improvement in the model. Overall, the analysis suggests that the model is effective but could be further refined to enhance accuracy, especially for certain cases.

# Time Series Analysis of Happiness Data

## Analysis Performed
The time series analysis examined the dataset in `happiness.csv` to determine the stationarity of the "Life Ladder" score over time. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was utilized, yielding key statistics to evaluate the presence of unit roots in the data series.

## Insights from Results

### Key Findings:
- **ADF Statistic**: -48.91
- **p-value**: 0.0
- **Critical Values**: 
  - 1%: -3.43
  - 5%: -2.86
  - 10%: -2.57
- **Stationarity**: The series is classified as stationary.

### Description of Insights Discovered:
The extremely negative ADF statistic (-48.91) and a p-value of 0.0 provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis of the presence of a unit root. This confirms that the series of Life Ladder scores is stationary and does not depend on time, suggesting consistent behavior over the observed periods.

### Implications of Findings:
1. **Policy and Decision Making**: The stationary nature of the data indicates that trends in the Life Ladder scores can be analyzed for long-term planning without concern for time-dependent changes.
  
2. **Predictability**: The stable nature of the data points to the ability to forecast future values using historical averages, enhancing the ability to understand factors impacting happiness.

3. **Need for Further Investigation**: While the stationary result is insightful, it also invites further investigation into causal factors affecting the occasional peaks and valleys, potentially linking them to societal changes or events.

### Chart Analysis Summary:
To analyze the chart titled "Time Series of Life Ladder," we observe several insights based on the trends and fluctuations in the data:

1. **Overall Trend**: Fluctuating levels of happiness over time indicate varying responses to social or economic factors.
  
2. **Peaks and Valleys**: Distinct peaks show periods of happiness, while valleys reflect dissatisfaction, suggesting external influences.

3. **Volatility**: The data shows volatility, possibly impacted by economic or political changes.

4. **Potential Patterns**: Further analysis may reveal seasonal trends linked to specific annual events.

5. **General Level**: The average happiness score remains moderate, signaling a generally stable quality of life despite fluctuations.

In conclusion, the "Time Series of Life Ladder" chart underscores the dynamic yet stable nature of life satisfaction, revealing both periods of prosperity and challenges. More granular analysis could provide additional insights through correlation with specific events or trends.

# Outlier Detection Analysis on happiness.csv

## Analysis Performed
The analysis function `outlier_detection` was applied to a dataset containing 2,363 samples sourced from `happiness.csv`. The goal was to identify anomalies within the data, with a specific focus on detecting unusual values that may distort overall trends or patterns related to happiness metrics.

## Insights from the Results
The results indicate that out of the 2,363 samples, **267 anomalies** were identified. This represents approximately **11.3%** of the total dataset, suggesting a notable presence of outliers.

## Description of Insights
The identification of 267 anomalies suggests that there are significant deviations in happiness scores or the associated features. These outliers could stem from various factors, such as data entry errors, extreme cases of happiness or dissatisfaction, or unique socio-economic conditions affecting certain groups.

## Implications of Findings
The presence of a substantial number of outliers can have implications for further analysis:

1. **Data Cleansing**: Attention should be given to the identified anomalies to determine if they represent legitimate cases or if they need to be removed to ensure the integrity of subsequent analyses.

2. **Understanding Variability**: The existence of these anomalies may indicate diverse experiences of happiness among different demographic or geographic groups. This could lead to more targeted and effective interventions.

3. **Modeling Impact**: Machine learning models trained on the dataset need to account for these outliers, as they could skew predictions or affect model performance. Techniques such as robust scaling or outlier treatment methods should be considered.

In summary, while a certain level of outlier presence is expected in any dataset, the findings of this analysis prompt a closer examination of the data's underlying factors and the necessity for appropriate handling in further investigations.
